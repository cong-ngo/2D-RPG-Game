#  2D Fantasy RPG Game in Java

 A personal, story-driven 2D pixel RPG developed in Java by Cong Chi Ngo, blending classic adventure gameplay with modern object-oriented programming principles. Inspired by *The Lord of the Rings* and the smooth mechanics of *Celeste*, this game is designed to demonstrate core CS skills, storytelling, and real-time gameplay mechanics.

##  Overview

This game is a part of my independent summer project to deepen my Java skills, enhance my college application, and bring my love for fantasy games to life. I’m responsible for all programming, logic, and gameplay design, while my partner handles graphics and visual assets. I did have to follow a tutorial series on Youtube to set up the game and build the basic functions for it, then I furbished it by adding more movements, tasks, map,... we also personalized our own styles, characters, entities,...

##  Features (Planned & In Progress)

- ✅ Smooth character movement: left, right, jump, crouch
- ✅ Dialogue interaction system with NPCs
- ✅ Task & quest system (talk to NPCs to unlock quests)
- ✅ Combat system with hit detection and health bar
- ✅ Magical items (e.g., sword, potions)
- ✅ Inventory system: collect, equip, use items
- 🧭 Basic map design with different areas
- 🔊 Sound & music effects (planned)
- 🎨 Pixel graphics and animations by my partner

##  Game Structure

- **Java + Object-Oriented Design** (no game engine used)
- **Key Classes**:
  - `Player.java` — character movement, jump logic
  - `NPC.java` — dialogue and quest interaction
  - `Entities.java` — basic AI and attack detection
  - `Game.java` — class to connect and excecute all the other classes
  - `mainClass.java` — runs the main game loop
- **Tile-based layout** using 2D arrays and collision checks

## Dev Log

### Week 1 (i've done this before adding the project to gitHub)
- Set up the Java project, created player movement and controls
- Built rough prototypes for jump, crouch, and basic enemy logic

### Week 2
- Added NPC interaction system with simple dialogue trees
- Started item system (pick up + inventory logic)

### Week 3
- Built prototype quest system (player receives + completes task)
- Added magical item boost effects (sword = +attack)

_(More logs to come!)_

## 🧠 Purpose & Vision

> "I wanted to create something that blends my love for storytelling and programming. This game is more than a school project—it's how I learned to think like a developer, solve real problems, and create joy for players. My goal is to publish it on itch.io or Steam if it reaches a polished state."

---

## 📦 Future Goals

- Export as `.exe` or `.jar` for distribution
- Publish on [itch.io](https://itch.io) for free access
- Optional Steam release if game quality is high
- Polish UI/UX and test with real players

## 🙏 Special Thanks

- Kaarin Gaming, thank you so much much for the 2022 platformer tutorial, it's the core contribution to this project. It     helped me to build the basic version of the game, includes setting up window, movement, key and mouse listener, gravity and so forth...I love you
- Michael, a software engineer at Nvidia, for inspiring discussions on AI and engineering
- My younger sister, for being the first person to test my ideas
- The online dev community and open-source guides that helped me get started
